# libRL
A Python library for characterizing Microwave Absorption.

This Library is to include all of the functions and methods developed at the University of Missouri-Kansas City 
under NSF grant DMR-1609061.

The libRL module can be installed via pip and git

        pip install git+https://github.com/1mikegrn/libRL

once installed, simply import the module as normal, and query the
docstring via libRL --help - the docstrings include a list of the available
functions for use. Full documentation is also available at the DocSite,
which is accessible via the DocSite badge above.
